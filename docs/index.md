Provides a collection of estimators for regression models with
outcome-dependent right-censored covariates, including inverse
probability weighting (IPW), augmented IPW (AIPW), and maximum
likelihood estimators. Methods are motivated by and applied to
Huntington disease data. For full methodological details, see the paper
"Robust Estimation under Outcome Dependent Right Censoring in Huntington
Disease: Estimators for Low and High Censoring Rates."
