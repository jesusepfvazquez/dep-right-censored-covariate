Description: Provides a collection of estimators for regression models with 
 outcome-dependent right-censored covariates, including the inverse probability weighting (IPW), 
 augmented IPW (AIPW), and maximum likelihood estimators. Refer to the paper, Robust Estimation 
 under Outcome Dependent Right Censoring in Huntington Disease - Estimators for Low and High Censoring Rates
