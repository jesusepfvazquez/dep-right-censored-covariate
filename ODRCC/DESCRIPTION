Description: Provides a collection of estimators for regression models with
    outcome-dependent right-censored covariates, including inverse probability
    weighting (IPW), augmented IPW (AIPW), and maximum likelihood estimators.
    Methods are motivated by and applied to Huntington disease data. For full
    methodological details, see the paper "Robust Estimation under Outcome
    Dependent Right Censoring in Huntington Disease: Estimators for Low and
    High Censoring Rates."
